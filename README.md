# BURGER TIME
Devour Burger(DB) is a single-page web application that was built using a Model View Control(MVC) design pattern. Model View Controller divdes the program logic into the three interconnected elements: Model data manipulation, View or user interface, and Controller that works as the dispatcher for the full system design.
The application is supported and deployed with Node Express, MySql, Handlebars and Heroku.
